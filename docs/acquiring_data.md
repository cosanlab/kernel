# Acquiring Data
Read the [Kernel documentation](https://docs.kernel.com/docs/handling-the-flow2-headset) for how to acquire data.

We are currently using the CIM laptop that has the kortex acquisition driver installed.

All software and data can be accessed via kernel [web portal](https://portal.kernel.com/).

## Procedures
Please read the short [documentation](https://docs.kernel.com/docs/handling-the-flow2-headset) on the kernel website about how to set up the Flow2 and acquire data.

## Notes
So far we are finding that dark colored hair is making it difficult to acquire data.
